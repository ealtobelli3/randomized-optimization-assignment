Randomized Optimization Assignment by Liz Altobelli

Steps for running my code:
  1. Download CSV files (See Sources > Data below)
  2. Set up Jupyter Notebook environment
  3. Download my python file here: https://github.com/ealtobelli3/randomized-optimization-assignment (file name: "ML Assignment 2.ipynb")
  4. Ensure proper libraries are installed (see Sources > Libraries)
  5. Run each cell from the top of the notbeook down
      Note: accuracy metrics & graphs may differ slightly with each run
